Making Self Driving Car efficiently 
# This project is Under Development 
## Progress:
### Lane Detection 
1. OpenCv for Changing to Grayscale form RGB
2. Applying basic Lane detection using Gradient value of pixels from Image
3. Applying Canny filter for Approximating the Image for finding average line out of set of lines
4. Using Hough Transform for finding Lines in the image. We will be using Polar Coordinate Geometry ( If we would have used Cartition Coodinate Hough Transform, then it would not able to fined lanes for vertical line as it would have failed for vertical lines. Thus we will be using Polar Coordinates for doing the same.
